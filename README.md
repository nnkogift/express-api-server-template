# Express API Server Template

## Introduction

This is a minimal implementation of a RESTful API server using Express.js. It is designed to be used as a starting point
for building a server. It is set up with necessary build tools and dependencies as well as minimal typescript setup.
## Usage

To use this template simply click
on [Use this template](https://github.com/nnkogift/express-api-server-template/generate) button in github, or clone the
repository.

To start the server in development mode run the following command:

```bash

 yarn start

```

To build the server for production run the following command:

```bash

 yarn build

```

The build will create a folder called `app` in the root of the project. You can deploy this folder to a server and run the production server using the command:

```bash

 node index.js

```
